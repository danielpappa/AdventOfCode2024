# Advent of Code 2024 🎄🎿

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges 🥶 :

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar 🍫 of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework 🧑‍🎓 , practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. 😃

## Structure

This repository is organized by day 📆 :

Each day's directory contains:

*   `input.txt`: The personal input data for that day's challenge.
*   `solution.ipynb`: The solution to both the first and second part of the day's challenge.
